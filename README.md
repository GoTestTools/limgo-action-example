This repo contains an example on how to use [limgo-action](https://github.com/GoTestTools/limgo-action). 

The tests in this example cover 84.62% of all Go code statements. In the coverage config `.limgo.json`, however, a gloabl threshold of 90% is required. Therefore, the respective step in the workflow fails and exports the coverage results as an artifact (see [this workflow run](https://github.com/GoTestTools/limgo-action-example/actions/runs/3204041041)).
